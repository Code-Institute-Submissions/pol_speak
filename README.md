# *Pol_speak* the quick and useful English to Polish translator
## The Milestone project 3 by Stan Kaczorkiewicz

The main purpose of this project from my point of view is to prove that I'm familiar and efficent while working with Python and databases, while still taking good care of the front-end design.

From the user perspective, this project is supposed to help in a in-work communication with Poles, or just any interaction with Polish- speaking people. It always helps to get positive reactions for your presence from foreigners, 
if they see you trying to communicate with them in their language.
Here, hopefully, I can provide a tool, that will allow dear users to do so.

# UI 
I identified a user as:
- a person who works with immigrants from Poland in the warehouse or office,
- someone willing to learn few words in new language, without care for grammar etc,
- English speaking person who want to travel to Poland
- A person who is attracted in Polish-speaking man or woman.




# Credits

While creating this app, I used some external sources:
- coolors.co to choose the colors palette
- materialize.com to use some CSS and JavaScript. Also it's worth to mention, that it was my first project with     something else than bootstrap. 
- I was inspired by the Code Institute course materials, espacially the last mini-project with databases.
